summary: >
  I am a Backend Engineer with 2+ years of experience building cloud-based backend services and distributed systems.
  I work primarily with Java and Spring Boot to design and develop RESTful APIs, 
  microservices, and event-driven service platforms using Kafka, Redis, and SQL/NoSQL databases. 
  I have contributed to high-throughput, multi-tenant messaging and cloud service systems, 
  with a focus on reliability, scalability, and operational stability. 
  I hold a Master’s degree in Computational Science and am motivated to build reliable, production-grade systems in enterprise environments.

jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AvrilLiu/tree/main/linux_sql"
    description: >
      Developed a Linux cluster monitoring system on Rocky Linux to collect hardware and resource usage metrics using Bash scripts.
      Automated data ingestion into a Dockerized PostgreSQL database with crontab scheduling,
      enabling centralized monitoring and reducing manual operational overhead.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AvrilLiu/tree/main/core_java"
    description:
      - "JDBC Stock App: Built a Java-based CLI application for managing stock portfolios, supporting quote lookup, buy, sell, and performance tracking. Integrated a real-time stock data REST API and persisted data to PostgreSQL via JDBC. Implemented structured logging with SLF4J, containerized the application using Docker, and managed dependencies with Maven. Validated core functionality through unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java application that replicates core functionality of the Linux grep command using object-oriented design. Implemented recursive file traversal and regex-based pattern matching, leveraging Java Streams and Lambda expressions for efficient data processing. Added logging with Logback and packaged the application into a Docker image using Maven for dependency management."
  - name: "Spring Boot Trading App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AvrilLiu/tree/main/springboot"
    description: >
      Developed a Spring Boot–based trading application that exposes RESTful APIs for stock quote retrieval, order execution, and portfolio management, with an emphasis on clear service boundaries and backend correctness. The application integrates an external market data API for real-time pricing, applies a layered architecture (controller, service, DAO) to separate business logic from persistence concerns, and enforces validation and error handling to maintain data integrity. Relational data models were designed and implemented with JDBC and PostgreSQL, complemented by structured logging, containerized deployment using Docker, and unit and integration tests to verify end-to-end trading workflows.

highlighted_projects:
  - name: "Roots & Route (Volunteer Engineering Project, Canada)"
    git_url: ""
    description: >
      Developed an AI-assisted trip planning platform as a volunteer engineering project, collaborating with team members based in Alberta while working from Toronto. Designed backend services to automate itinerary generation and multi-tenant route management, integrating AI-driven workflows for dynamic travel planning. Implemented data persistence and authentication using Supabase, with a focus on maintainable service design, reusable business logic, and reliable data flows to support real-world usage scenarios.

  - name: "Custom Java RPC Framework (Netty)"
    git_url: ""
    description: >
      Designed and implemented a lightweight Java RPC framework to explore service-to-service communication patterns and performance trade-offs in distributed systems. Built on Netty with dynamic proxy–based invocation, pluggable serialization (Kryo and Protobuf), and connection-level heartbeat handling to detect failures. Focused on low-latency request handling, connection management, and basic fault tolerance to support reliable communication between backend services.

  - name: "Raft Consensus Algorithm"
    git_url: ""
    description: >
      Implemented core components of the Raft consensus algorithm, including leader election, log replication, and failure recovery, to study consistency and fault-tolerance behavior in distributed systems. Focused on state transitions, term management, and correctness under node failures and network partitions, gaining practical understanding of how consensus protocols maintain replicated state across unreliable nodes.

  - name: "Operational Data Classification with Machine Learning"
    git_url: ""
    description: >
      Designed and implemented a supervised classification project to analyze operational system data, focusing on data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. Trained and compared standard classifiers and evaluated results using precision and recall to understand model behavior and generalization characteristics. The project emphasized methodological correctness and practical application of machine learning techniques in system monitoring and observability scenarios.
