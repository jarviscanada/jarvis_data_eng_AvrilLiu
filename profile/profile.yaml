jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    source_code: ""  # TODO: add GitHub project source code URL
    description: >
      Built a Linux-based cluster monitoring agent to collect system hardware
      and resource usage metrics across multiple nodes. Implemented Bash scripts
      to extract CPU, memory, disk, and uptime data, and automated data ingestion
      into a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Scheduled minute-level data collection
      using crontab and validated functionality through manual testing on Rocky Linux
      virtual machines. Enabled centralized visibility into cluster performance and
      reduced manual monitoring overhead.

  - name: "Java Grep Application"
    git_url: "/core_java/grep"
    source_code: ""  # TODO: add GitHub project source code URL
    description: >
      Developed a Java-based command-line application that replicates core
      functionality of the Linux grep utility. Implemented recursive directory
      traversal and regex-based pattern matching using object-oriented design,
      Java Streams, and Lambda expressions to improve readability and performance.
      Integrated structured logging with Logback and managed dependencies with Maven.
      Containerized the application using Docker for portable execution and
      manually tested functionality and edge cases in a Linux environment.

  - name: "Stock Quote Application"
    git_url: "/core_java/stockquote"
    source_code: ""  # TODO: add GitHub project source code URL
    description: >
      Developed a Java-based backend application providing RESTful APIs for
      stock data management. Implemented a layered architecture with Spring Boot,
      including controller, service, and DAO layers using JDBC for database
      interaction. Added structured logging with SLF4J and Logback, and
      containerized the application with Docker for consistent deployment.
